# Credit_Card_Analysis_Machine_Learning
# Overview 
## Purpose
Machine learning can be used to predict credit card risk and solve loan approval questions becasue credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem. The purpose of this project was to use the Python's Sciki-learn (sklearn) library to build and evaluate models using resampling and determine which models can best predict credit risk.
## Analysis Roadmap
Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
For this deliverable, youâ€™ll write a brief summary and analysis of the performance of all the machine learning models used in this Challenge.
The report should contain the following:
# Analysis
Results of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
# Results: Using bulleted lists
- Accuracy scores
Models 1-6 produced the following accuracy scores:
- Precision scores
Models 1-6 produced the following precision scores:
- Recall scores
Models 1-6 produced the following accuracy scores:

# Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
